# JavaScript / TypeScript Interview Problems

This repository contains a variety of interview-style programming problems which you can use to hone your skills. The problems are free for anyone to use.

Navigate into one of the subfolders and open the Markdown file to see the problem description. All problems are designed to be solvable in CodeSandbox in a 50 minute timeframe.

I created these problems for use in the [SpotCoders online coding meetup](https://www.meetup.com/spotcoders/). If you'll be attending the meetup, please do not look ahead at future problems!

## Instructions for SpotCoders Participants

1. Decide if your team will use JavaScript or TypeScript. Either is fine but TypeScript is encouraged.
2. Look at the problem description to see if React is required, optional, or prohibited. If React is optional, decide if you will use it.
3. Everyone should go to https://codesandbox.io/ and log in.
4. One person from the team needs to create the sandbox. Select one of the following templates, based on your choice of language and framework:
   - Vanilla (JavaScript without React)
   - Vanilla TypeScript (TypeScript without React)
   - React (JavaScript with React)
   - React TypeScript (TypeScript with React)
5. Once the sandbox is created, click the icon that looks like two people in the left sidebar of the CodeSandbox UI. Copy the live link from this tab.
6. Paste the live link in the room chat in Spot. Room chat can be accessed by clicking the chat icon in the upper right of the screen.

If you finish the problem before time is up, use the remaining time to improve your solution or start on the other problem. E.g. if you completed the beginner problem, start on the intermediate problem.

## General Rules

- Feel free to Google stuff! Just don't search for the solution to the exact problem you are working on.
- You can bring in any library you want unless stated otherwise in the problem description.
